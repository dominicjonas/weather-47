# sei-ga-project-2

 Project #2: Reactathon
Overview
The second project is to build a React application that consumes a public API.

For this project, we'll work in pairs.

Technical Requirements
Your app must:

Consume a public API – this could be anything but it must make sense for your project.
Have several components - Favour functional components, but you can use class components if you like. Think about structuring them into files logically.
The app can have a router - with several "pages", this is up to your discretion and if it makes sense for your project.
Include wireframes - that you designed before building the app.
Be deployed online and accessible to the public.
Necessary Deliverables
A working application, hosted somewhere on the internet
A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
A link to your hosted working app in the URL section of your Github repo
A readme.md file with:
Explanations of the technologies used
A couple of paragraphs about the general approach you took
Installation instructions for any dependencies
Link to your wireframes – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles your team had to overcome
