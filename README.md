## Plan 

Create an app using React that takes 2 APIs and dynamically displays weather information based on user input.

## Setup

- Will need to add node modules
  - yarn install  /  npm install  
- Will need a api token from Accuweather --> create account --> create new app --> key is generated.
    - This is needed if the current key has expired (after 50 calls). 
    - 'lib' folder
     - 'accuWeatherApi.js' --> key  
- yarn start / npm start to run the app in your browser.
